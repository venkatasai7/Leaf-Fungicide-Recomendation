# Leaf-Fungicide-Recomendation

**INTRODUCTION:**
In countries like India it is of utmost importance to bring technological  advancement in the fields related to crop productivity.

Crops worth Rs 50,000 crore are lost owing to pest and disease attack every year because of not able to find a the disease and treat it in early stages.

This automation will help the farmers to reduce their efforts and also their working time. By using this method, we can differentiate between the normal leaves and the diseased leaves.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

To minimize the amount of time required to find the type of plant disease and to propose a solution for it

In our system we are using CNN model which is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data

Train a model which gives better accuracy and identify the plant disease fast
